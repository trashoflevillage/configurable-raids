Create your own raids through a simple JSON file! This file is located at ``.minecraft/config/configurable_raids.json``. On top of being able to make your own raids, you can even give each level of bad omen completely different raids!

**Note: This mod replaces the raids that are part of the vanilla game. I've attempted to recreate the waves from hard mode, but it is imperfect, and applies to every difficulty.**
