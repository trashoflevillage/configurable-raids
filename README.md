Create your own raids through a simple JSON file! This file is located in ``.minecraft/config/configurable_raids.json``. On top of being able to make your own raids, you can even give each level of bad omen completely different raids!

**Note: This mod (currently) gets rid of each difficulty having different waves. Apart from that, vanilla raids are untouched.**
